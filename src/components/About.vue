      <p>
        This Civic app is my final capstone projects for the WATS 4030. With elections coming up,
        I wanted to build a web app that is useful to look up elected officials, and their contacts.
        I built the project to meet the requirements for the class, and I plan on adding fucntionalities,
        as elections get closer.
